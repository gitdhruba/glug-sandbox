# glug-sandbox

# Overview
This project implements a secure sandbox environment for executing user programs. The sandbox ensures isolation and security by monitoring the programâ€™s CPU time, memory usage, and system calls. If the program exceeds predefined CPU or memory limits, the sandbox terminates the process and provides detailed logs of the event.


# Features

1) Resource Monitoring:

    CPU Time: Tracks the total CPU time consumed by the program.

    Memory Usage: Monitors memory allocation and usage.

    System Calls: Logs and analyzes all system calls made by the program. (using ptrace)


2) Limit Enforcement:

    Terminates the program if it exceeds the predefined CPU time or memory usage limits.


# Architecture

    This is divided into two parts: 

        1) Sandbox (child process): This executes the user program after imposing resource-limits on itself. Check sandbox() function in [sandbox.c](https://github.com/gitdhruba/glug-sandbox/blob/main/sandbox.c).

        2) Monitor (parent process): This is meant for constantly monitor the resource usage of Sandbox and intercept and analyze system calls invoked by Sandbox. Thus    provides a safe execution environment for untrusted code. Check monitor() function in [sandbox.c](https://github.com/gitdhruba/glug-sandbox/blob/main/sandbox.c).


# Prerequisites

    To run and test this project a GNU/Linux Operating system with gcc installed is needed.
    NOTE: this project may not work properly on other operating systems (like Windows NT, Mac OS) as it is fully based on Linux System call API
